Gitflow helps organize your repository history, making it easier to manage releases, bug fixes, and features.

## Configuration

To configure Gitflow in GitKraken Desktop:

1. Navigate to <code>Preferences > Gitflow</code>.
2. Optionally, change the default branch names.

Once initialized, two branches will always be present:

- <code>main</code>: the version in production.
- <code>develop</code>: the current development version for the next release.

If these branches don't exist locally, GitKraken Desktop will create them when Gitflow is initialized.

***
## Usage

After initializing Gitflow, a Gitflow panel appears in the left sidebar. Use it to start or finish Gitflow branches.

To create a Gitflow branch:

- Click the green button in the Gitflow panel.
- Or name a branch with a Gitflow prefix (e.g., <code>release/branch-name</code>).

Branches with a Gitflow prefix appear in the Gitflow panel. Others appear in the local repository section only.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Gitflow organizes features, hotfixes, and releases into separate folders.</p>
</div>

Publishing a Gitflow branch (i.e., pushing it to a remote) works the same as with regular Git branches.

### Feature

Feature branches are for new features or bug fixes. They're typically local and not shared.

When you finish a feature branch:

- It's merged into <code>develop</code>.
- It's deleted from the local repository.

Optionally, rebase the feature branch onto <code>develop</code> before finishing.

### Release

Release branches represent versions shared with collaborators.

When you finish a release branch:

- It's merged into both <code>main</code> and <code>develop</code>.
- A tag is created with the release name.

### Hotfix

Hotfix branches are similar to releases but created from <code>main</code>. Use them for urgent production fixes.

Examples include bug fixes or typos that must go live immediately.

When you finish a hotfix:

- It's merged into both <code>main</code> and <code>develop</code>.

### Tag

Tags mark specific points in your repository's history, such as releases.

Create tags from the Gitflow panel or the command line. When tagging from the Gitflow panel:

- The tag name matches the branch name (e.g., <code>release/1.0.0</code> â†’ <code>1.0.0</code>).
- You can add a message to the tag.

<br>
<br>
<img src="/wp-content/uploads//tag-message.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered" alt="Tag message dialog">

In <code>Preferences > Gitflow</code>, set a tag prefix (e.g., <code>v</code>). This prefix is added to tags (e.g., <code>v1.0.0</code>).
