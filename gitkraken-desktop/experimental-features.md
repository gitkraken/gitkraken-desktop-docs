GitKraken Desktop includes experimental features, which are early previews of in-development functionality. These features may change or be removed in future releases.

---

## Access Experimental Features

To access experimental settings:

- Go to <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> <kbd><strong>Preferences</strong> <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i> Experimental</kbd>

Experimental features are optional and can be enabled or disabled at any time. If you experience issues or have feedback, [contact support](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-desktop/contact-support/?issue_category__customer_facing_field_=Experimental+feedback&subject=GitKraken+Client+Experimental+feedback).

## Git Executable

This setting allows GitKraken Desktop to use your system’s Git executable instead of NodeGit for core Git operations. It can enhance compatibility and performance.

**Enable it from:** <kbd>Preferences > Experimental > Use Git Executable</kbd>

GitKraken ships with Git built-in, or you can select a system Git path.

### Features Using Git Executable

Git actions that currently use the Git executable (by version):

**v9.4.0–10.8.0:**
- Commit, fetch, push, pull
- Branch rename/delete, merge base
- Tag creation/deletion, revert commits
- Cherry-pick, rebase, checkout, clone
- Staging, unstaging, stash support
- SSH signing, Git Credential Manager
- Discard changes, undo/redo, hooks output

See full details per release in the [GitKraken Desktop release notes](/gitkraken-desktop/current/).

### What Are Cloud Patches?

A Cloud Patch is a Git patch that GitKraken securely stores so you can share it across GitKraken Desktop, GitLens, and CLI. Use them to:
- Share work-in-progress with teammates before a pull request
- Apply changes across machines or collaborators securely

### How to Enable

Cloud Patches require the **Git Executable** to be enabled (it is by default).

### Create a Cloud Patch

1. Stage files in the Commit Panel.
2. Click the Cloud Patch icon.

You can also right-click any commit in the graph and select <kbd>Share commit as Cloud Patch</kbd>.

### Share and Apply Cloud Patches

- Copy the link from the toast or Left Panel
- Options:
  - Anyone with the link
  - Anyone in my org (requires GitKraken login)
  - Only selected collaborators (requires login)

Recipients can open the patch and apply it to a selected branch.

### Self-Hosting Cloud Patches

You can self-host Cloud Patch data on an AWS S3 instance instead of GitKraken servers. See [Security Controls](/gk-dev/gk-dev-security-controls/#self-hosted) for setup instructions.
