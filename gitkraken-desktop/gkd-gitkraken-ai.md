GitKraken offers built-in AI features to fast track your workflow—no extra tools, no switching interfaces.

## AI-Powered Commit Explain

GitKraken can generate natural language explanations of your commits, right from the UI.

### How to use Commit Explain

1. Open GitKraken Desktop and select one or more commits (Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd>)

3. GitKraken provides an AI-generated summary of what changed in that commit.

## AI-Generated Commit Messages

You can generate clear, consistent commit messages based on your staged changes.

### To generate a commit message:

1. Stage your changes.

## Bring your own key

By default, commit explanations and message generation use **Gemini**, and no API key is required—requests are included as part of your GitKraken subscription.

If you prefer to use **OpenAI** or **Anthropic** with your own API key, you may configure this in your settings from <kbd>Preferences > GitKraken AI</kbd>.

Additionally you may include **custom instructions** to guide how GitKraken AI generates messages or explanations for Commit Message Generation and Explain Commits respectively:
