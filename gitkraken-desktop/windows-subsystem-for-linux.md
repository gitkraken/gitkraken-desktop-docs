Learn how to run GitKraken Desktop on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), including GUI integration and installation requirements.

## What is WSL/WSL 2?

<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about" target="_blank">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a> enables developers to run a Linux distribution and use Linux tools directly on Windows. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions" target="_blank">WSL 2</a> runs an actual Linux kernel in a managed VM, offering better performance and full system call compatibility.

To support Linux GUI apps, Microsoft introduced <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps" target="_blank">WSLg</a>, which integrates Linux apps into the Windows desktop experience. This feature makes GitKraken Desktop for Linux run smoothly within WSL 2.

> Microsoft recommends storing project files on the same operating system as the tools you're using to avoid cross-OS performance issues.

GitKraken Desktop works with repositories stored on your WSL 2 file system when installed and launched inside the WSL environment. With <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps" target="_blank">WSLg</a>, GitKraken Desktop displays natively within Windows.

<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> GitKraken Desktop does not support accessing repos across file systems. Install GitKraken on the OS where your repos are stored to avoid degraded performance or non-functional features.</p>
</div>

GitKraken will notify you when accessing repos across environments. For more, see [Working Across File Systems](#working-across-file-systems-in-wsl-2).

### Setup Steps

Follow these four steps to get started:

1. **Update WSL 2** — Ensure the latest version is installed with WSLg support.
2. **Download GitKraken Desktop** — Get the latest Linux version.
3. **Install in WSL** — Run the installer from your WSL 2 terminal.
4. **Launch GitKraken Desktop** — You're ready to start working!

> Most WSL distributions include Git by default. If needed, [install or update Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).

## WSL 2/WSLg Requirements

- Windows 11 or Windows 10 build 19044+
- WSL 2 distribution
- GitKraken Desktop version 9.1.0+ for Linux

---

## Install or Update WSL 2 with WSLg Support

GitKraken Desktop requires WSL 2 with WSLg support on Windows 11 or Windows 10 build 19044 or later.

To update WSL from PowerShell or Command Prompt (run as Administrator):

```bash
wsl --update
```

To install WSL with Ubuntu as the default distribution:

```bash
wsl --install -d ubuntu
```

After rebooting, complete the setup by creating a Linux username and password.

WSLg is automatically included in this installation.

## Download and Install GitKraken Desktop on WSL 2

To install GitKraken Desktop within WSL, follow the <a href="https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-desktop/how-to-install/#linux-deb-rpm-and-tar-gz-files" target="_blank">Linux installation instructions</a>.

For Ubuntu users:

```bash
wget https://api.gitkraken.dev/releases/production/linux/x64/active/gitkraken-amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./gitkraken-amd64.deb
```

If dependencies are missing, fix broken packages with:

```bash
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

Then, launch GitKraken Desktop with:

```bash
gitkraken
```

> If using the `.tar.gz` version, ensure `gitkraken` is in your PATH for the above command to work.

## Preferences for GitKraken on WSL 2

GitKraken Desktop offers preferences to control how URLs and files are opened from the WSL environment. Navigate to `Preferences` > `General` to configure them.

    <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #888;">Choose where to open URLs and files when using GitKraken within WSL 2.</figcaption>
</figure>

By default:
- URLs open in your Windows default browser.
- Files attempt to open on the WSL host distribution.

## Known Issues with WSL 2

Here are known limitations when using GitKraken Desktop with WSLg:

- <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/388" target="_blank">HiDPI displays</a> may cause WSLg to inconsistently scale the UI.
- <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/727" target="_blank">Window snapping</a> might not function properly within WSLg.

## Troubleshooting WSL 2

If GitKraken opens with a black screen or other display issues, try these fixes:

- Reopen GitKraken Desktop as administrator.
- Update your graphics drivers.

If issues persist, you can disable GPU acceleration:

```bash
gitkraken --disable-gpu
```

To bypass certificate errors (e.g., `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`), run:

```bash
gitkraken --ignore-certificate-errors
```

To fully restart WSL (use PowerShell or Command Prompt as administrator):

```bash
wsl --shutdown
```

Then, reopen your Linux distribution or GitKraken Desktop.

## Working Across File Systems in WSL 2

GitKraken Desktop does not support opening repos stored on a different file system than where GitKraken is installed.

For the best experience:
- Install GitKraken Desktop on both Windows and WSL.
- Use the correct GitKraken instance based on repo location.

When accessing a repo stored on WSL from GitKraken installed on Windows (or vice versa), you'll see a prompt:

<figure class='figure center'>
    <img src="/wp-content/uploads/wsl-toast.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/wsl-toast@2x.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered" alt="GitKraken WSL toast warning">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #888;">Prompt for cross-system repo access in GitKraken Desktop.</figcaption>
</figure>

You can choose:
- **Open Help Center** — Opens this guide.
- **Open with GitKraken on Ubuntu/Windows** — Switch to the correct GitKraken instance.
- **Open Anyway** — Attempt to open the repo (may result in degraded performance or broken features).
- **Close** — Cancels the action.

<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> GitKraken cannot detect cross-system access when using mapped network drives. This may lead to unintended behavior.</p>
