GitKraken Desktop’s **Conflict Prevention** helps you identify potential merge conflicts before they happen, reducing delays and easing collaboration.

## How Conflict Prevention Works

GitKraken detects potential conflicts from **Org Members** by identifying overlapping edits in committed changes that haven’t yet merged into the target branch.

### 1. Conflict Alert Icon

When you open GitKraken Desktop, an alert icon indicates potential conflicts.

</figure>

### 2. View Conflict Details

Clicking the icon opens a menu with options to investigate and address the conflict.

  <figcaption style="text-align:center; color:#888">Conflict details with management options</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class='callout callout--success'>
  <p>Active conflicts with the target branch take priority over Org Member alerts.</p>
</div>

### 3. Resolve Conflicts Early

From the conflict detection menu, you can:
- Share edits as a **Cloud Patch**
- Push changes to make them visible to others
- Copy summaries of overlapping edits for your team

## Conflict Detection Without Org Members

Even if your repository has no Org Members, GitKraken still checks for conflicts with your **target branch**.

You’ll be prompted to merge or rebase proactively.

</figure>

### Target Branch Status When No Conflicts Are Found

If no potential conflicts are detected:
- A status indicator confirms your branch is conflict-free
- You’ll see quick links to open a pull request or adjust preferences

## Invite Contributors to Resolve Conflicts Earlier

Invite the authors of conflicting changes to your GitKraken Org directly from the conflict menu:

<figure>
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/invite-to-org-11-1.png" srcset='/wp-content/uploads/invite-to-org-11-1@2x.png' class="help-center-img img-bordered">
  <figcaption style="text-align:center; color:#888">Send invites to potential collaborators from the alert</figcaption>
</figure>

Once added, you’ll receive real-time updates when they’re working in the same areas.

## Configure Conflict Prevention Settings

Conflict Prevention settings are repository-specific. You can:
- Set which branches GitKraken should monitor
- Use `**` for wildcards or `!` to exclude branches

Navigate to <kbd>Preferences > Conflict Prevention</kbd> to configure these settings.
