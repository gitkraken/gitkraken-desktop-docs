Have you ever made a Git change and immediately wished you could take it back? Whether itâ€™s an accidental commit, a discarded change, or a deleted branch, GitKraken Desktop lets you undo many actions quickly and safely.

You can undo many common actions with a single click of the **Undo** button. If you undo something by mistake, you can also **redo** it just as easily.
