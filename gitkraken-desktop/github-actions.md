<a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a> is a service provided by Github, which can help automate your workflow. More specifically, it allows you to add/edit/delete _workflows_, which are files stored in `.github/workflows` as part of the GitHub Actions feature.

###Create Workflow

GitKraken Desktop will allow you to create new workflows from the left panel.

Hovering over `GitHub Actions` and clicking the <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>+</button> button will open the `Create Workflow` panel. From here you can select from availible workflow templates or create a blank workflow. Workflows will be placed in the `.github/workflows folder` that GitHub uses (it will create the folder if none exists).
