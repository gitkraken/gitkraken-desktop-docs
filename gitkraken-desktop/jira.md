## Connect Jira Integration

Alternatively, you may copy the token from the _Success_ page and paste it into the Jira Cloud integration screen in GitKraken Desktop.

## Preview Jira Issues

Once connected, your Jira issues will appear in the Left Panel. By default, the app displays issues assigned to you under the _My Issues_ filter.

Hover over any issue to preview key details including Title, Description, Status, Assignee, and Reporter.

Click an issue to open its detail view.

You can:

- Edit Title and Description

- Assign or reassign
- Add comments

These changes will sync with your Jira board.

The issue will sync directly with your connected Jira project.

## Create Filters

You can create filters to show specific issues. The integration supports Atlassian’s JQL (Jira Query Language) and provides auto-complete for filter fields.

For advanced filtering tips, see Atlassian’s [JQL guide](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/expand-jira/jql#visualize-results).

## Create Branches from Issues

You can create branches tied to Jira issues directly from the issue detail view.

The branch name is prefilled based on the issue title. After creation, branches linked to Jira issues display the Jira icon.
