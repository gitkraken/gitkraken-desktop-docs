Detached HEAD state lets you check out any commit in GitKraken Desktop without creating a branch. This is useful for reviewing or experimenting with past changes without affecting your active branches.

***

## Enter Detached HEAD State

1. Right-click the commit you want to inspect.
2. Select <kbd><strong>Checkout this commit</strong></kbd>.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #888;">Check out any past commit without creating a new branch.</figcaption>
</figure>

The checked-out commit will display a `HEAD` label, indicating you’re in detached HEAD state.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #888;">GitKraken tags the commit with HEAD.</figcaption>
</figure>

You can now review the full history and diffs, or create a branch from this state.

## Commit in Detached HEAD State

You can make changes and commit them while in this state. However, these commits won’t belong to any branch.

</figure>

To preserve your work, create a branch from the current commit:

1. Right-click the commit tagged as HEAD.
2. Select <kbd><strong>Create branch here</strong></kbd>.

</figure>

## Exit Detached HEAD State

To exit detached HEAD state:

- Check out any local branch.

This will remove the `HEAD` label and discard any unpreserved commits.

  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Commits made in detached HEAD state will be lost unless you create a branch. You may be able to <a href='https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-desktop/detached-head-state/#recovering-lost-commits'>recover them manually</a>.</p>

## Recover Lost Commits

If you accidentally switch branches before saving your changes:

- Click <a href="https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-commits/undo-and-redo/">Undo</a> in GitKraken if available.
- Use the CLI and run [`git reflog`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog) to find the lost commit SHA.
- Then use [`git checkout <SHA>`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) to re-enter that state.
