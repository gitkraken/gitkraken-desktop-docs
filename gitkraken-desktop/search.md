Learn how to search for commits in GitKraken Desktop.

***
## Initial number of displayed commits 

By default, GitKraken Desktop displays up to 2000 commits on the Commit Graph. To view a deeper history of your repo, set the initial number of commits to display on the graph to your preference. 

Navigate to <kbd>Preferences</kbd> from the gear menu in the upper right corner, and find <kbd>Initial Commits in Graph</kbd> under <kbd>General</kbd>. There is no limit to how many commits can be displayed.

       alt="Preferences > General view in GitKraken Desktop, with 'Initial Commits in Graph' highlighted to show where to set the number of commits to display.">
  <figcaption style="color:#888; text-align:center">Set the number of commits to display in the Commit Graph from Preferences.</figcaption>
</figure>

Above this setting, you'll also find an option to <kbd>Show All Commits in Graph</kbd> for large repositories. 

## Search bar

The search bar in the upper right of the application defaults to commit search.

</figure>

Search commits by message, SHA, or author. GitKraken Desktop updates the results live and highlights the commit in the Commit Graph.

To search from anywhere in the app, open the Command Palette:

<table class='table table--bordered table--shortcuts'>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th>Mac</th>
            <th>Windows/Linux</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Toggle Command Palette</td>
            <td><kbd>&#8984;</kbd><kbd>P</kbd></td>
            <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>P</kbd></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
