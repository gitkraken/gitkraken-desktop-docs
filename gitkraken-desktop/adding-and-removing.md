## Adding a file

Add a file to GitKraken Desktop using the Command Palette.

To initiate the Command Palette, hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>, type `Create File`, and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

You can also right click the empty space in the commit panel and click the `Create File` context menu option.

## Filter files

If you tick the `View all files` option, you'll gain access to the <kbd>Filter Files</kbd> bar. Use this to quickly jump to a specific file or to filter by a file type.
