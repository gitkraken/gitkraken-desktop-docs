    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Other auto-complete programs can cause the Terminal auto-complete suggestions to not work. You may need to uninstall or disable these programs before using the Terminal.</p>

Different views can be accessed using the `gkc` CLI program in the Terminal:

* `gkc panel`: toggles the visualization panel. Also has parameters to reposition the panel top/bottom/left/right.
* `gkc graph`: shows the graph view. Same behavior as the `gk panel`, but additionally it will return to the graph if you're in a different view, and has subcommands for toggling the graph columns with the keyboard.
* `gkc history` and `gk blame`: opens the history/blame panel for a specific file.
* `gkc diff`: shows changes between commits. If no SHAs are provided, it will use your WIP and HEAD. If only one SHA is provided, it will be compared with HEAD.
* `gkc --help`: shows the list of `gk` commands.
