If GitKraken Desktop is running slowly, it’s often due to the size or complexity of the repository. Try the steps below to improve performance.

***

## Improving Performance

Performance issues are commonly linked to large repositories with many references. Try these steps to improve responsiveness:

### Repository-Level Actions

- Use the <kbd>Perform Repo Maintenance</kbd> command from the [Command Palette](/start-here/command-palette). This runs `git maintenance run`, which may take several minutes on large repos.
- Run [`git gc`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc) in your local repository.
- Clone a fresh copy of the repository to a new directory.

### Interface Optimization

- Disable auto-fetch by setting the [Auto-fetch interval](/gitkraken-desktop/preferences/#auto-fetch) to `0`.
- Reduce the number of commits shown in the graph by setting a lower [Max Commits value](/gitkraken-desktop/preferences/#max-commits-in-graph).
- [Solo or Hide](/gitkraken-desktop/hiding-and-soloing/) branches and tags to reduce visual complexity.

### Cleanup and Maintenance

- [Delete unnecessary local branches](/gitkraken-desktop/branching-and-merging/#delete-a-branch).
- If using Git LFS, perform an [LFS prune](/gitkraken-desktop/git-lfs/).
- Run [`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) to check for unexpected working directory states.
- Restart GitKraken Desktop daily to clear any accumulated memory or cache usage.


### Verify your GitKraken Desktop build on macOS

Some Mac users have noticed that GitKraken Desktop **11.5.1** may feel less responsive. In most cases, the Mac installed the wrong build for the machine’s chip (Intel vs. Apple Silicon).

It’s an easy check:

1. **Open GitKraken.** Navigate to the **GitKraken** menu from the top left of your machine.

   <figure>
     <img src="/wp-content/uploads/arm2.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered" alt="Check your version number and build (arm64 64-bit)" />
     <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #888">Check your version from the GitKraken menu.</figcaption>
   </figure>

2. **Confirm the build matches your Mac’s chip** (Apple Silicon/arm64 vs. Intel/x64).

3. **If it doesn’t match,** [download the correct version](https://www.gitkraken.com/download) and reinstall.
