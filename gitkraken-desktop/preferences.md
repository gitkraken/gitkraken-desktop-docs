## Organization

This section will actually be labeled with your organization name rather than "Organization".  It shows the members and teams within your organization. Click `switch organization` to swap to another organization.

The Owner and any Admins are able to:

- Change role of members within the organization
- Invite members to the organization and purchase licenses
- Create and manage teams


<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> the Organization section is only available to users who have a Pro or Enterprise license.

</div>

## General

### Auto-Fetch

Set the number of minutes between auto-fetches. This value must be between 0 and 60 minutes, and it will fetch all visible remotes for the repository. Setting the value to 0 minutes will disable auto-fetch.

If youâ€™re experiencing issues with performance, consider setting your auto-fetch value to 0 and restarting the application. 
 
### Auto-Prune

Removes any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote.

### Automatic Conflict Detection

GitKraken will monitor your base branch for conflicts and alert you with an icon in the toolbar when conflicts are detected, providing options to resolve your conflicts sooner rather than later.
Unchecking this option will disable the automatic conflict detection feature for all repositories. You can disable this feature on a per-repo basis by going to the repo preferences and unchecking the box for automatic conflict detection.
More information on [Automatic Conflict Detection](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-desktop/branching-and-merging/#automatic-conflict-detection-preview)

### Keep Submodules Up to Date

When enabled, GitKraken Desktop will automatically update all submodules after performing a Git action. This setting can be configured on a per-repo basis.

### Default Branch Name

Set the default name when initializing a new repo. The app defaults to `main`.


### Delete ".orig" files

GitKraken Desktop will make .orig files during a merge. If turned off, these before and after files will not be automatically deleted. 

### Show All Commits in Graph

Enabling this option will force GitKraken Desktop to always show all commits in repo. This setting may cause performance issues with large repositories.

### Initial Commits in Graph

Set the max number of commits GitKraken Desktop will show in the graph. Lower counts may help improve performance, and the minimum value is 500 commits.

### Lazy Load Commits

When enabled, GitKraken Desktop will only load additional commits if you reach the earliest commit in the Graph. This setting may cause performance issues with large repositories.

### Remember tabs

This will remember open tabs when you quit GitKraken Desktop. This option will also remember what tabs you have open for each profile. 

### Longpaths (Windows Only)

For Windows users, GitKraken Desktop will respect the `core.longpaths` setting in the global .gitconfig. Adjusting this setting will change `core.longpaths` in your .gitconfig. `core.longpaths` only applies to the files in the working directory, not in the .git directory, to maintain compatibility with Git for Windows.

### AutoCRLF (Windows Only)

For Windows users, GitKraken Desktop will respect the `core.autocrlf` setting in the global .gitconfig. Adjusting this setting will change `core.autocrlf` in your .gitconfig. Enabling this option auto-converts CRLF line endings into LF when adding a file to index, and vice versa when checking out code onto your file system. For more information check out this [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_core_autocrlf)


### Use extended logging in activity log

Provides more information for the activity log. You may access the activity log from <kbd><strong>Help > Support Logs > Activity Logs</strong></kbd>.

### Forget all Usernames and Passwords

Removes credentials that currently stored by GitKraken Desktop.

### Share work-in-progress status with my team

Allows other users in your team to see your local work in progress files. This is directly related to the [Teams](/working-with-repositories/teams) feature.
