GitKraken Desktop connects with the <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?product=gitkraken&source=help_center" target="_blank">Git Integration for Jira</a> app. This integration enables seamless navigation between GitKraken Desktop and Jira, letting you open commit and file diffs directly from your Jira issues.

---

## Setup Requirements

Before using this integration, ensure the following:

1. Connect the [Jira Cloud Integration](/integrations/jira) in GitKraken Desktop.
2. Set <kbd>Preferences > Issue Tracker</kbd> to use Jira Cloud for the relevant repository.
3. Select a Jira Project in the Left Panel.
4. The Git Integration for Jira app must be installed on the same Jira Cloud instance.

## Open File Diff in Jira

Once connected, a <strong>Open in Jira</strong> button appears in the [file diff view](/gitkraken-desktop/diff/). Clicking this opens the specific file diff in your Jira instance.

## Open Jira to a Commit

Right-click any commit in the graph and choose <strong>Open in Jira</strong>. This launches Jira focused on the selected commit.

## Open GitKraken from Jira

Within Jira, Git Integration for Jira adds buttons to open commits and diffs in GitKraken. Look for the GitKraken logo to launch GitKraken Desktop for a deeper view.
