## What Happens When...

GitKraken Desktop handles links dynamically depending on your local setup:

- **Repository is not open**: The app will try to open it automatically.
- **Repository is not cloned**: You'll be prompted to clone and the modal will be pre-filled.
- **Multiple copies of the repo**: You'll be prompted to choose which local copy to use.

Deep links streamline collaboration by ensuring you and your teammates view the same Git objects instantly, even across different environments.
