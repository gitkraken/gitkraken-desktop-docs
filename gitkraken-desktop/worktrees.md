## What Are Worktrees?

A Git worktree is a linked working copy of your repository. Each worktree:

- Has its own working directory and index
- Shares Git history with the main repository
- Lets you keep different branches checked out simultaneously

Worktrees are useful when you want to:

- Work on multiple features or fixes without switching branches
- Build or test alternate versions of your code
- Experiment safely while keeping your main branch clean
- Review pull requests without halting other work

Once committed, changes in one worktree become visible in others.

## Using Worktrees in GitKraken Desktop

GitKraken Desktop has supported worktrees since version **10.5.0**. From the Left Panel, you can:

- Create and switch between worktrees
- Remove or lock/unlock worktrees
- Hover over a worktree to see its full file path

### Create a Worktree

To create a worktree:
1. Right-click a branch in the Repository View
2. Select <kbd>Create worktree</kbd>

- Or check out the corresponding branch from the Repository View

### Delete a Worktree

To remove a worktree:
1. Right-click it in the Left Panel
2. Select <kbd>Remove this worktree</kbd>

### Lock or Unlock a Worktree

To change lock status:
- Right-click the worktree and choose <kbd>Lock this worktree</kbd> or <kbd>Unlock this worktree</kbd>

Locking a worktree prevents accidental changes while you work elsewhere.
