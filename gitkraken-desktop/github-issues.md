### Connect GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration and GitHub Issues integration share the same connection. You can Set up the integration from the ISSUES pane in the Left Panel or from <kbd><i>Preferences   <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>   Integrations</i></kbd>.

From the Integrations window, select _GitHub.com_ and then hit the <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Connect to GitHub</button> button.

Note that required fields are denoted by `*`. Your new issue will automatically be added to your GitHub issues.

### Create Filters

You may create filters to view the issues you need. We use the same syntax that GitHub uses for their issues.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/create-github-filter.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/create-github-filter@2x.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

You can refer to [GitHub issue filtering](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests) docs from GitHub for more information.

### Create Branches from Issue

You may create a branches tied to an issue from the issue details view <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Create a branch for this issue</button> button. You can also right-click the issue or click the <kbd> <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i> </kbd>.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/create-branch-github-issue.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/create-branch-github-issue@2x.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

The branch name will automatically prefill based on the issue name. After the branch is created, these branches will be denoted with the GitHub icon to reflect its link to a GitHub issue.

From here, it should be possible to configure triggers on the GitHub side for changes made to this branch.

### Copy Issue link or View in GitHub

You can quickly navigate to the issue in GitHub from the <kbd> <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i> </kbd> menu or by clicking <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> in the top right.
