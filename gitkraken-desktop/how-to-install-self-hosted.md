GitKraken Self-Hosted Server runs on a Linux virtual machine (CentOS, Ubuntu, or RHEL7) inside Docker containers, so before we can boldy go where no Kraken has gone before, we'll have to install Docker.

##  Install GitKraken Self-Hosted Server

<span>1.</span> Extract _GitKrakenEnterpriseServer.zip_ in a folder of your choosing
(all commands in the following instructions will be performed in that folder).

<span>2.</span> Load the images into Docker:
```
sudo sh loadImages.sh
```

<span>3.</span> Configure what port GitKraken Self-Hosted should run on the host server.
By default GitKraken Self-Hosted server will run on port 3000.

  You can change the port by opening up the _docker-compose.yml_ file and making a few modifications.  
  First, find the `ports` section under `gk-enterprise-controller`:
  ```yaml
    ports:
      "3000:3000"
  ```

  Modify the first `3000` to the desired port
  For example, to use port 80 change it to:

  ```yml
    ports:
      "80:3000"
  ```

  Then update the `GITKRAKEN_ENTERPRISE_URL` environment variable to use the desired port.  Again, for port 80 it would look like:
  ```yaml
    environment:
        GITKRAKEN_ENTERPRISE_URL: http://localhost:80
  ```

  Finally, find the `GITKRAKEN_ENTERPRISE_URL` environment variable in the `gk-services` section and modify the port.  For port 80, this would look like:
  ```yaml
    environment:
        GITKRAKEN_ENTERPRISE_URL: http://localhost:80
  ```
<span>4.</span> *Optional* Update the base URL from localhost. If you want to access the user management page from outside of this server, you will want to update the base URL. This means updating `GITKRAKEN_ENTERPRISE_URL` wherever it exists in the `docker-compose.yml` file. An example:

  ```yaml
    environment:
        GITKRAKEN_ENTERPRISE_URL: http://gitkraken.example.com:80
  ```
  
<span>5.</span> Configure where GitKraken Desktop releases are stored on your host server.
By default the releases folder is set to _./gk-data/release_. You can change the location by opening up
the _docker-compose.yml_ file and finding the section under `gk-enterprise-controller`:
```
volumes:
 ./gk-data/release:/controller/release # The volume where GitKraken Self-Hosted clients go.
```
and modifying _./gk-data/release_ to point to another directory on your host server.

<span>6.</span> Create the folder specified in the above step on your host server.

<span>7.</span> Extract _release.zip_ in the folder you created on your host server
(releases will always be extracted in this folder).

<span>8.</span> In the same folder containing the _docker-compose.yml_ file, run the following command:
```
sudo docker-compose up
```
  * To run this command in the background, use `docker-compose up -d` instead.
  * Note: If installing in CentOS or RHEL7, you may need to specify the full path to the docker-compose installation.  The following commands should allow you to run the docker-compose command successfully:
```
sudo systemctl start docker.service
sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose up
```

<span>9.</span> Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and complete the setup
(the port in the URL should match the port from step 3, and the URL should match step 4, if either was changed).
