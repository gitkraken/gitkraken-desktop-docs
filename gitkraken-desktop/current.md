### New ✨
 - **GitKraken AI:** A seamless extension of your development workflow, [GitKraken AI](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-desktop/gkd-gitkraken-ai/) automates tedious tasks to improve your efficiency and focus.
   - Commit Message Generation
     - You'll now be able to generate clear, meaningful commit messages based on your code changes in just a click.
     - With a WIP selected, click on the sparkle icon in the commit message form to have GitKraken AI generate a commit message for you based on your staged changes.
   - Explain Commits
     - You can now get detailed summaries of changes made in your repository without spending time diving through files and diffs.
     - With one or multiple commits selected in the Commit Graph, click on the `Explain` button in the top right of the Commit Panel to generate an explanation of changes made in the selected commits.
   - Configure GitKraken AI from _Preferences > GitKraken AI_
     - Use the `Custom Instructions` setting to provide additional details so GitKraken AI can better tailor commit messages and explanations for you.
     - With GitKraken AI enabled, you can also select to use your own API key to make requests directly to OpenAI or Anthropic. When one of those providers is selected, you can choose what model you'd like to use for each AI feature.
     - Note: The AI Commit Message Generation section has been removed from _Preferences > Experimental_.
